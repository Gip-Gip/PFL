#The Public File License

The Public File License is a simple and permissive license that, unlike MIT or
BSD, does not require you to supply a copy of the license with the file
(granted, you should still do that) and allows anyone to do anything with your
file and anything taken from that file, as long as that isn't patenting or
claiming further copyright on it. It was made by an average Joe, so it should
be relatively easy to understand. If you notice something that doesn't make any
sense, you can raise an issue and I will get it fixed! Here's a small list of
what PFL is:

 * It covers any single file (and the contents of that file)
 * It was created and is maintained by a normal human being
 * It allows people to use a different license once they modify the file

#Adding The License To Your Works

If you wish to add the PFL to any of your files, simply copy the license
provided below to a file named license.txt and replace all the brackets
with whatever is decribed inside of them. Also, it is a good idea to put
the license inside the file itself, if you can.

#The License Itself

    The Public File License (see https://github.com/Gip-Gip/PFL for info)

    Copyright (author's name), (date license)

    In this case, a file is a group of digital data that can be transferred
    and used.

    The copyright holder of the file (filename) has declared that the file
    and everything taken from it, unless stated otherwise, is free for any
    use by any one, with the exception of preventing the free use of the
    unmodified file, including but not limited to patenting and/or claiming
    further copyright on the unmodified file.

    THE FILE (filename) IS PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE AT ALL
    THE AUTHOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR CLAIMS, DAMAGES, OR REALLY ANYTHING ELSE IN
    CONNECTION TO THIS FILE, UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE.
